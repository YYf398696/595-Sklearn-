For question 1
 (0.007247415087058018, 'B'),
 (0.01434886624794653, 'TAX'),
 (0.014523968162298069, 'AGE'),
 (0.05761207945048276, 'ZN'),
 (0.07687583303059971, 'INDUS'),
 (0.10920325494942389, 'CRIM'),
 (0.25847305564727235, 'RAD'),
 (0.438269991354161, 'LSTAT'),
 (0.9231097946622095, 'CHAS'),
 (0.9708050502857913, 'PTRATIO'),
 (1.6139252016403234, 'DIS'),
 (4.009936947150388, 'RM'),
 (18.35664852609919, 'NOX')]
So the impact from big to small accoding to the model is: NOX->RM->DIS->PTRATIO->CHAS->LSTAT->RAD->CRIM->INDUS->ZN->AGE->TAX->B

For question 2
For the iris dataset, we can see that the elbow is at k=3.
For the Wine, Seems 2 and 3 both look likes a elbow, I think 2 and 3 will all consider as a good population size using the elbow method.
